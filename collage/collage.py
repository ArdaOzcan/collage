    * This function is used for saving average colors of the images in the database to a file 
    so the program doesn't have to apply this every time when using the same database.
    
    What it does : 
    
        -Takes a database path and iterates through the list of images in that database
        -Calulates the average color of the image by using numpy.average() and appends it to the list 'files_avg_col'
        -Writes 'files_avg_col' to a json file 
    
    NOTE :  The image is resized to a smaller version to reduce iteration, user specifies the resize amount
            'files_avg_col' list is converted to an integer array with .astype(int) because numpy.average() returns a float array
            Reversed the 'average_color' array before appending to 'files_avg_col' because cv2 uses BGR format for colors 
            Used .tolist() because type 'ndarray' is not JSON serializable

    Function Description:
    
    * This function finds the closest multiple of 'crop_size' that is smaller than the image shape
    so the chunks(every square in the result image) that have a shape of (crop_size x crop_size)
    can fill the whole image perfectly.
    
    What it does :

        -Iterates through the shapes of images (width and heigth)
        -Floors the shape/crop_size and multiplies it by crop_size
            ( 
                Example :   if the shape is 340 and crop_size is 7,
                            340/7 ( shape/crop_size ) would be 48,57...
                            Floor of 48,57.. is 48 
                            and 48 * 7 is 336â€¬                        
            )
        -Appends the new value to a 'new_shape'
        -Returns 'new_shape' after the loop is finished

    
    Example :   if the given image's shape is 300x224 and 'crop_size' equals to 7,
                the function would return [294, 224] since the closest multiple of 7 that is smaller than 300 is 294
                and the closest multiple of 7 that is smaller than 224 is 224

    so the function 'arrange(colors, json_file, memes)' can use the returned list to find the closest color.
    
    What it does :

        -Resizes the image (see 'new_shape()')
        -Crops the image using numpy indexing ( A single chunk has the size of (crop_size x crop_size) )
        -Appends 'current_average' to 'average_list'

    What it does  :

        -Converts 'colors' to a numpy array
        -Converts 'colors' ( if its dimension is bigger than 2 ) to a 2-dimensional array by multiplying every dimension except the last one
         since the last dimension represents RGB values and should always stay as 3
         so an array with the shape (2, 2, 3) would become (4, 3) like in the example
            (                
                Example:    

                    if 'colors' was

                    which is 3-dimensional, using a for loop wouldn't work because
                    
                    for color in colors:
                        print(color)
                        
                    would output : 
                    
                    0   [[  0   0   0]
                        [255 255 255]]

                        [  0   0   0]]
                        
                    but we need : 
                    
                    0   [  0   0   0]
                    1   [255 255 255]

            -Returns 'file_names_list' after the loop is finished
        
    NOTE :  Searching algorithm can be replaced with a better one because :
    
                1. This one is not very efficient ( This function usually takes the most time )
                2. Finding the absolute closest image causes repetition of images
                
                So a less precise ( possibly a little random ) and more efficient algorithm could be used
