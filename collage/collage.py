    What it does : 
    
        -Takes a database path and iterates through the list of images in that database
        -Calulates the average color of the image by using numpy.average() and appends it to the list 'files_avg_col'

    so the chunks(every square in the result image) that have a shape of (crop_size x crop_size)
    can fill the whole image perfectly.
    
    What it does :

        -Iterates through the shapes of images (width and heigth)
        -Floors the shape/crop_size and multiplies it by crop_size
            ( 
                Example :   if the shape is 340 and crop_size is 7,
                            340/7 ( shape/crop_size ) would be 48,57
                            Floor of 48,57.. is 48 
                            and 48 * 7 is 336â€¬                        
            )
        -Appends the new value to a 'new_shape'
        -Returns 'new_shape' after the loop is finished

    
    Example :   if the given image's shape is 300x224 and 'crop_size' equals to 7,
                the function would return [294, 224] since the closest multiple of 7 that is smaller than 300 is 294
                and the closest multiple of 7 that is smaller than 224 is 224

    What it does :

        -Resizes the image (see 'new_shape()')

        -Converts 'colors' to a numpy array
        -Converts 'colors' ( if its dimension is bigger than 2 ) to a 2-dimensional array by multiplying every dimension except the last one
         since the last dimension represents RGB values and should always stay as 3
         so an array with the shape (2, 2, 3) would become (4, 3) like in the example
            (                
                Example:

                    0   [  0   0   0]

    NOTE :  Searching algorithm can be replaced with a better one because :
    
                1. This one is not very efficient ( This function usually takes the most time )
                2. Finding the absolute closest image causes repetition of images
                
                So a less precise ( possibly a little random ) and more efficient algorithm could be used
